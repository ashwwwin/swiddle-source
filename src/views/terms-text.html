                    without regard to its conflict of law provisions. <br> <br>

                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                    those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                    remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                    agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might

                    No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                    failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision. <br> <br>

                    If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to
                    the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and
